// This is a simple GUI application using Qt that allows the user to enter commands
// and see the output. The commands 'ls' and 'dr' are handled with specific outputs.
// The application is designed to be cross-platform, but the command 'dr' is specific
// to Windows. The GUI consists of a text edit area for command input, a button to run
// the command, and a label to display the output. The layout is managed using QVBoxLayout.
// The application is built using the Qt framework, which provides a rich set of
// widgets and tools for creating cross-platform applications. The main function initializes
// the QApplication and creates an instance of MainWindow, which is then shown. The
// application enters the event loop with app.exec(), allowing it to respond to user
// interactions. The GUI is simple and straightforward, making it easy for users to
// enter commands and see the results. The use of lambda functions for signal-slot
// connections allows for a clean and concise way to handle button clicks and update
// the output label. Overall, this application serves as a basic example of how to
// create a cross-platform GUI application using Qt, with a focus on command execution
// and output display. It can be further extended to include more commands and features
// as needed. The application is designed to be user-friendly, with a clear layout and
// intuitive controls. The use of QTextEdit allows for multi-line input, making it
// suitable for longer commands or scripts. The QPushButton provides a clear action
// for the user to execute their command, while the QLabel displays the results in a
// straightforward manner. The application can be easily modified to include additional
// functionality, such as error handling, command history, or more complex command
// parsing. The use of Qt's signal and slot mechanism allows for a responsive and
// interactive user experience, with immediate feedback on command execution. The
// application can be built and run on various platforms, including Windows, macOS,
